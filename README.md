# B2C-Housing-site

In this assignment I have developed from scratch a B2C site identical to Airbnb.

The web site is implemented in Java and they have been used the below technologies:
1)JSP/Servlets.
2)JPA for accessing, persisting, and managing data between Java objects / classes and a relational database.
3)MySQL Database.
4)Npm library of node.js to perform sentiment analysis of customers' reviews.
